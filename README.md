Yet another WYSIWYG Markdown editor written in TypeScript and Tauri. Aims to be an open-source alternative to Typora.

> **[Markditor]** = **[Mark]** down + e **[ditor]**.
> Supports Windows 10 / 11 by now.

## Technology Stack

Markditor is heavily based on [Vditor](https://github.com/Vanessa219/vditor), and we used a modified version of it. [(Check out repo)](https://github.com/greyovo/vditor). In addition, we also built on top of the following technology stack:

- React
- **Tauri** (preferred) / Electron
- Zustand
- Radix-UI
- Tailwind CSS
- Vite

## Features

- Instant-render for Markdown typing
- User-friendly table editor
- Auto-save within internal seconds
- Dark mode support

## Download

Go to [releases](https://github.com/greyovo/MarkditorApp/releases) page.

## TODOs

- [ ]  Internationalization (i18n)
- [ ]  Insert images by: dropping, pasting (automatically copy to `asset` folder)
- [ ]  Drag & drop to: open files, or insert images
- [ ]  Enhance file management: drag and drop to move files, watch file changes from outside, automatically save when switching windows.
- [ ]  Source code mode
- [ ]  Export to: PDF or HTML
- [ ]  Support macOS, Linux (technically available, but lack of testing devices to confirm)

## Project Architecture

```js
├─build           // Build assets used by electron-builder
├─dist            // Web contents build output
├─dist-electron   // Electron prebuilt files
├─electron        // Electron main process
├─public          // Public files to be used in HTML
├─release         // Electron build output
├─shared          // Shared types definitions between renderer and main processes
├─src             // Front-end sources
│  ├─assets       // Static assets, i.e., fonts
│  ├─components   // Global components
│  ├─feat         // Feature modules
│  ├─ipc          // IPC communication
│  ├─store        // Zustand stores and business logics
│  ├─types        // Global type definitions
│  └─utils        // Utility functions
└─src-tauri       // Tauri backend process and build output
```

## Development

> Note: Markditor is initially made with Electron, **but currently Tauri is preferred.** So far Electron is still in development but has some unimplemented Platform API. See `electron/main/handler`. Electron backend may be deprecated in the future.

By encapsulating IPC communication (see `shared/platform_api.d.ts` and `src/ipc`), Markditor can be easily migrated to other backends such as Tauri.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run in dev mode:
